        <p>Customer-focused software engineer with a decade of experience delivering mobile applications and websites to millions of users, and inventor of a gesture-based input patent with 146+ industry citations.</p>

        <p>From Microsoft Surface IR frameworks to Getty’s Contributor app, I specialize in bridging digital and physical interactions. Recent prototypes — AirType, CountAR, and FaceTrackAR — apply XR Hands and computer vision to advance more natural and intuitive interaction models.</p>
