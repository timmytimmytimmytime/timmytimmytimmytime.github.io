        <p>Building software with the goal of delighting customers while solving real world problems. Passionate about taking an idea off the whiteboard, prototyping it quickly, and shaping it into a tangable experience.</p>

        <p>My journey began in <strong>consumer internet services at global scale</strong> — spanning mail, messaging, payments, and internationalized web platforms — expanded into new interface frontiers with <strong>gesture interfaces</strong>, grew through years of <strong>web frontend</strong> and <strong>mobile app</strong> development, and now continues into <strong>emerging technologies that connect digital products with the physical world.</strong>.</p> 
        
        <p>From computer vision and spatial interaction to AI and large language models, I’m always looking for new ways to translate innovation into experiences customers love.</p>
